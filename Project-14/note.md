note1: grid would take all over the display, if the width and height of the boxes are set down and the width and height of the container element are settled down (which is bigger than box).
set container attribute display:grid
the extension height would distribute to each box evenly which would leave gap between.

If the box don't set the height but just the width; set display: grid of container element, which would make each of the box occupy the whole container.
read article of https://learncssgrid.com/ and experiment the grid box to see what would happen.

set display: flex to see what would happen.

(you must know that almost all of the tutorials only cover the basic concept of the CSS attribute, and when you do the exercises or personal projects, you would meet many problems, and you would find out those issues never mentioned in tutorials, so make your own notes to make it clear.
)

note2:
grid expend the height or width of the whole container
