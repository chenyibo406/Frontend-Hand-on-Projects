        In this demo you can control the position property for the yellow box.
      </p>
      <div class="box-container">
        <div class="box-1"></div>
        <div class="box-2"></div>
        <div class="box-3"></div>
      </div>

      <!-- TODO: fix position demostration: put box-2 outside of the box-container -->
      <!-- <div class="box-2"></div> -->

      <p>
        To see the effect of sticky positioning, select the position: sticky
        option and scroll this container.
      </p>
      <p>
        The element will scroll along with its container, until it is at the top
        of the container (or reaches the offset specified in top), and will then
        stop scrolling, so it stays visible.
      </p>
      <p>
        The rest of this text is only supplied to make sure the container
        overflows, so as to enable you to scroll it and see the effect.

        Far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of the
        western spiral arm of the Galaxy lies a small unregarded yellow sun.
        Orbiting this at a distance of roughly ninety-two million miles is an
        utterly insignificant little blue green planet whose ape-descended life
        forms are so amazingly primitive that they still think digital watches
        are a pretty neat idea.
