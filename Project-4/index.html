<!DOCTYPE html>
<!-- All HTML documents must start with a <!DOCTYPE> declaration.
    The declaration is not an HTML tag. 
    It is an "information" to the browser about what document type 
    to expect. In HTML 5, the declaration is simple:  <!DOCTYPE html> -->
<html lang="en">
  <!-- The <html lang=”en-US’> specifies the language 
    code of the page followed by the country code that 
    means US style of English language is used for all 
    the text on the page.
 -->
  <head>
    <!-- The <head> element is a container for metadata (data about data) and is placed between the <html> tag and the <body> tag. HTML metadata is data about the HTML document. Metadata is not displayed. 
        Metadata typically define the document title, character set, styles, scripts, and other meta information.  -->

    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <!-- The charset attribute specifies the character encoding for the HTML document.
The HTML5 specification encourages web developers to use the UTF-8 character set, which covers almost all of the characters and symbols in the world!
 -->
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />
    <!-- The X-UA-Compatible meta tag allows web authors to 
        choose what version of Internet Explorer the page should be rendered as.
         There is a very well explanation about this syntax, you can go deeper
        from here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6771258/what-does-meta-http-equiv-x-ua-compatible-content-ie-edge-do -->
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <!-- HTML5 introduced a method to let web designers take control over the
    viewport, through the
    <meta />
    tag. This gives the browser instructions on how to control the page's
    dimensions and scaling. The width=device-width part sets the width of the
    page to follow the screen-width of the device (which will vary depending on
    the device). The initial-scale=1.0 part sets the initial zoom level when the
    page is first loaded by the browser. Here is a link from W3schools of
    explanation everything very clear of this syntax:

    <title>Document</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="./index.css" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <script src="./index.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
